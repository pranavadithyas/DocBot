The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information. \\nThis EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\Christmas Hackathon\\\\data\\\\21pw36.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event \\nplanning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event '), Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\Christmas Hackathon\\\\data\\\\21pw36.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload \\nphotos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.

A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations. \\nSeveral key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\Christmas Hackathon\\\\data\\\\21pw36.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.

ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally, \\nknowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\Christmas Hackathon\\\\data\\\\21pw36.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='34  \\n4.4 CUSTOM NODES \\n \\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific \\npurposes, was undertaken. These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through \\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further \\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation. \\nContributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts \\nand image-to-video workflows. Additionally, issues related to custom nodes and workflows \\nwere troubleshot and resolved. \\nFigure 4.4 Custom Nodes \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.5 ComfyUI Manager '), Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\Christmas Hackathon\\\\data\\\\21pw36.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='35  \\n4.5 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: COMFYUI DEPLOY \\n \\nAs part of a team, contributions were made to the development of ComfyUI Deploy, a \\nproduct aimed at reducing GPU consumption. Traditionally, GPUs were allocated and charged \\neven during workflow setup. The goal was to modify the existing code so that GPUs would be \\nutilized only when necessary —specifically, when the “Run” button was clicked. This was \\nachieved by integrating the ComfyUI interface into an iframe using Next.js and establishing \\nWebSocket connections. This significant improvement helped reduce GPU consumption for \\nusers while maintaining a smooth workflow experience. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 ComfyUI Deploy \\n \\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION \\n \\nThe skill set was expanded by working on data analysis and visualization tasks using \\nthe Streamlit tool.

The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information. \\nThis EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.

A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations. \\nSeveral key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\Christmas Hackathon\\\\data\\\\21pw36.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology. '),\n",

ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally, \\nknowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs \\n'),\n",

These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through \\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further \\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation. \\nContributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts \\nand image-to-video workflows. Additionally, issues related to custom nodes and workflows \\nwere troubleshot and resolved. \\nFigure 4.4 Custom Nodes \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.5 ComfyUI Manager '),\n",

Traditionally, GPUs were allocated and charged \\neven during workflow setup. The goal was to modify the existing code so that GPUs would be \\nutilized only when necessary —specifically, when the “Run” button was clicked. This was \\nachieved by integrating the ComfyUI interface into an iframe using Next.js and establishing \\nWebSocket connections. This significant improvement helped reduce GPU consumption for \\nusers while maintaining a smooth workflow experience. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 ComfyUI Deploy \\n \\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION \\n \\nThe skill set was expanded by working on data analysis and visualization tasks using \\nthe Streamlit tool. Initially, dummy data was used, but later, the focus shifted to analyzing real \\ncompany data, which included user transactions, GPU usage, and more. Detailed dashboards \\nwere created to visualize trends across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, \\nquarterly, yearly), providing the company with valuable insights. \\n'),\n",

Event Management System (EMS): A comprehensive web platform was designed \\nto organize and manage college events, featuring end-to-end capabilities that foster \\ncross- departmental collaboration and maintain detailed digital records. \\n2. Governing Council Data Collection System: Data gathering from stakeholders was \\nstreamlined, automating the compilation of biannual reports. Key features were \\nimplemented to ensure efficient  data entry,  approval, and report generation, \\nimproving transparency and enabling data-driven decision-making. \\nAt JarvisLabs.ai, a cloud computing platform specializing in GPU services for AI/ML \\napplications, several key initiatives were undertaken to optimize platform resources and \\nenhance the user experience. ComfyUI workflows for AI art generation were developed using \\nstable diffusion models, with a focus on ComfyUI Deploy and product development to reduce \\nGPU consumption in ComfyUI. Additionally, the company's analytical capabilities were \\nstrengthened through the implementation of data visualization solutions using Streamlit. \\nVarious user interface features, such as invoice generation and file system UI, were developed \\nto improve the platform's web presence, while several website bugs were resolved. \\nThese projects contributed significantly to resource optimization, workflow efficiency, \\nand digital transformation initiatives across both organizations.\", \"1  \\nCHAPTER 1 \\nINTRODUCTION \\nA detailed description of the organization for which the application is developed is \\nexplained in this chapter.

The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information. \\nThis EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event \\nplanning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload \\nphotos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details \\n \\n✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations. \\nSeveral key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege.

The main objective of the company, providing GPU as a Service \\n(GaaS) on a cloud platform, was central to the project work, which introduced various aspects \\nof AI development, from image generation to cloud infrastructure optimization. \\n4.2 COMPANY PRODUCT \\n \\nJarvisLabs.ai is a cloud platform offering high -performance GPU instances (A5000, \\nA6000, RTX series) and pre -configured AI/ML environments with frameworks like PyTorch \\nand FastAI. It simplifies infrastructure management, enabling developers and researchers to \\ntrain models and run experiments without complex setups. With a pay -as-you-go pricing \\nmodel, it's accessible to both individual developers and teams.\", '32  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.1 GPU Instances \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.2 Frameworks', '33  \\n4.3 COMFYUI AND AI IMAGE GENERATION \\n \\nThe journey began with an exploration of ComfyUI, a sophisticated stable diffusion \\ntool for AI-driven image and video generation. ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally, \\nknowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs', '34  \\n4.4 CUSTOM NODES \\n \\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific \\npurposes, was undertaken. These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through \\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further \\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation. \\nContributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts \\nand image-to-video workflows. Additionally, issues related to custom nodes and workflows \\nwere troubleshot and resolved. \\nFigure 4.4 Custom Nodes \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.5 ComfyUI Manager', '35  \\n4.5 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: COMFYUI DEPLOY \\n \\nAs part of a team, contributions were made to the development of ComfyUI Deploy, a \\nproduct aimed at reducing GPU consumption. Traditionally, GPUs were allocated and charged \\neven during workflow setup. The goal was to modify the existing code so that GPUs would be \\nutilized only when necessary —specifically, when the “Run” button was clicked. This was \\nachieved by integrating the ComfyUI interface into an iframe using Next.js and establishing \\nWebSocket connections. This significant improvement helped reduce GPU consumption for \\nusers while maintaining a smooth workflow experience. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 ComfyUI Deploy \\n \\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION \\n \\nThe skill set was expanded by working on data analysis and visualization tasks using \\nthe Streamlit tool.

The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information. \\nThis EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event \\nplanning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload \\nphotos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details \\n \\n✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations. \\nSeveral key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege.

The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information. \\nThis EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event \\nplanning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload \\nphotos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details \\n \\n✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations. \\nSeveral key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege. This system plays a pivotal role in enhancing transparency, accountability, and \\ncommunication across the institution by enabling structured data collection and efficient report \\ngeneration for two half -yearly periods.

It simplifies infrastructure management, enabling developers and researchers to \\ntrain models and run experiments without complex setups. With a pay -as-you-go pricing \\nmodel, it's accessible to both individual developers and teams.\", '32  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.1 GPU Instances \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.2 Frameworks', '33  \\n4.3 COMFYUI AND AI IMAGE GENERATION \\n \\nThe journey began with an exploration of ComfyUI, a sophisticated stable diffusion \\ntool for AI-driven image and video generation. ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally, \\nknowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs', '34  \\n4.4 CUSTOM NODES \\n \\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific \\npurposes, was undertaken. These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through \\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further \\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation. \\nContributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts \\nand image-to-video workflows. Additionally, issues related to custom nodes and workflows \\nwere troubleshot and resolved. \\nFigure 4.4 Custom Nodes \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.5 ComfyUI Manager', '35  \\n4.5 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: COMFYUI DEPLOY \\n \\nAs part of a team, contributions were made to the development of ComfyUI Deploy, a \\nproduct aimed at reducing GPU consumption. Traditionally, GPUs were allocated and charged \\neven during workflow setup. The goal was to modify the existing code so that GPUs would be \\nutilized only when necessary —specifically, when the “Run” button was clicked. This was \\nachieved by integrating the ComfyUI interface into an iframe using Next.js and establishing \\nWebSocket connections. This significant improvement helped reduce GPU consumption for \\nusers while maintaining a smooth workflow experience. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 ComfyUI Deploy \\n \\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION \\n \\nThe skill set was expanded by working on data analysis and visualization tasks using \\nthe Streamlit tool. Initially, dummy data was used, but later, the focus shifted to analyzing real \\ncompany data, which included user transactions, GPU usage, and more. Detailed dashboards \\nwere created to visualize trends across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, \\nquarterly, yearly), providing the company with valuable insights.', '36  \\nBased on GPU Utilization \\n \\n• GPU Utilization: Visualizes the total GPU usage in hours across different time \\nperiods, helping track resource consumption. \\n• GPU Allocation: Shows the allocation of GPU resources across users or tasks, \\nproviding insights into how resources are distributed within the platform. \\n• Most Used GPU Type: Displays the most commonly used GPU type, helping \\nunderstand user preferences and optimize resource offerings. \\nBased on Users \\n \\n• Number of New Users: Tracks the total number of new users registered over a \\nspecified period, providing insights into user growth and platform adoption. \\n• Number of New Users Recharged: Monitors the count of new users who have made \\ntheir first recharge, indicating initial engagement and the effectiveness of onboarding \\nstrategies. \\n• Active Members Over Time: Visualizes the trend of active members over time, \\nhighlighting user retention and engagement levels on the platform. \\n• Churn Rate: Measures the percentage of users who stop using the service over a \\ngiven time frame, helping to assess user satisfaction and identify potential  areas for \\nimprovement. \\nBased on Recharge \\n \\n• Total Amount Recharged: Represents the cumulative amount of money recharged \\nby all users over a specified period, providing insights into overall platform revenue \\nand user investment. \\n• Total Amount Recharged by new Users: Tracks the total recharge amount \\ncontributed by new users, indicating their initial commitment and engagement with \\nthe platform shortly after registration.', '37  \\n• Total Amount Recharged by existing Users: Measures the total recharge amount \\nfrom existing users, reflecting ongoing user loyalty and continued usage of the \\nservice. \\n• Number of new users who Recharged within 1 month of creating their account: \\nCounts the number of new users who completed a recharge within the first month of \\naccount creation, highlighting the effectiveness of the onboarding process and user \\nconversion strategies. \\n4.7 DEVELOPMENT IN WEBSITE \\n \\nResponsibilities then shifted toward the frontend and backend development of the \\ncompany’s website, utilizing Next.js and FastAPI. New features such as invoice generation \\nand downloading, as well as the user interface for the file system, were developed. \\nIn the invoice generation feature, the jsPDF library was utilized to create PDF \\ndocuments efficiently. For Indian customers, the invoice defaults to applying GST, ensuring \\ncompliance with local tax regulations. For foreign customers, the applicable tax rate is \\nspecified, allowing for accurate billing based on their location. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Invoice Display', '38  \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.8 Invoice View \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.9 Invoice PDF', '39  \\nA file system storage is a service that enables users to store, manage, and access data \\nspecifically optimized for GPU workloads over the internet.

The system\\n\\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events,\\n\\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event\\n\\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and', 'tracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create,\\n\\nupdate, and mange events efficiently.\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details\\n\\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event-related images after the events have\\n\\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past,\\n\\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information.\\n\\nThis EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve\\n\\ncoordination and streamline event-related processes, fostering better collaboration across\\n\\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date.\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nSYSTEM FLOW\\n\\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from\\n\\ncreation to post-event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve', 'accessibility for both organizers and users.\\n\\nEvent Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue,\\n\\ndescription and other details through the system.\\n\\nDatabase Management: All event information stored in a centralized database\\n\\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.\\n\\n15\\n\\nEvent Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into\\n\\nupcoming and past events.\\n\\nPost-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other\\n\\nrelevant materials.\\n\\nFiltering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category\\n\\nto quickly find specific event information.\\n\\n2.3 OBJECTIVES\\n\\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows,\\n\\nAutomating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve\\n\\nefficiency.\\n\\nProviding a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of\\n\\nevent details.', 'Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related\\n\\nmedia.\\n\\nFacilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and\\n\\naccuracy.\\n\\nImproving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily\\n\\nfilterable format.\\n\\nEnhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event\\n\\nplanning.\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nSYSTEM DESIGN\\n\\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear\\n\\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database.\\n\\nUI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as\\n\\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event\\n\\n16\\n\\n2.5\\n\\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and\\n\\nstorage.\\n\\nFrontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with\\n\\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via\\n\\na user-friendly interface.', 'Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests,\\n\\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM.\\n\\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication.\\n\\nFile Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event-related files,\\n\\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records.\\n\\nFILE HANDLING AND STORAGE\\n\\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way:\\n\\nMinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images\\n\\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload\\n\\nphotos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage\\n\\nsystem. It provides a high-performance, scalable object storage solution that\\n\\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval\\n\\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded', 'which will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage.\\n\\nMulter: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload\\n\\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO.\\n\\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file\\n\\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object\\n\\nstorage.\\n\\n17\\n\\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN\\n\\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events,\\n\\nand file storage. Key tables include:\\n\\nUsers Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication.\\n\\nProfile Table: Stores profile information for each user.\\n\\nEvents Table: Stores core event information.\\n\\nEvent Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details.\\n\\nMedia Files Table: Stores media related to the event.\\n\\nEvent Host Table: Stores hosts of the event.\\n\\nRegistration Table: Handles event registrations.', 'Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events.\\n\\nPrizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions.\\n\\nGuest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details.\\n\\nSponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details.\\n\\nEvent Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or\\n\\nvideos.\\n\\nDatabase relationships:\\n\\nOne-to-One:\\n\\n✓ Events and Event Details\\n\\n✓ Events and Registration\\n\\nOne-to-Many:\\n\\n✓ Users and Profile\\n\\n✓ Users and Host\\n\\n✓ Events and Host\\n\\n✓ Events and Media Files\\n\\n18\\n\\n✓ Events and Competitions\\n\\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers\\n\\n✓ Events and Sponsors\\n\\n✓ Events and Event Files\\n\\n✓ Competitions and Prizes\\n\\nMany-to-One:\\n\\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event)\\n\\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event)\\n\\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event)\\n\\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event)\\n\\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event)', '✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event)\\n\\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event)\\n\\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition)\\n\\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.\\n\\n19\\n\\n2 0\\n\\nFigure 2.1 EMS\\n\\n2.7\\n\\nIMPLEMENTATION\\n\\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary\\n\\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using\\n\\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a\\n\\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual\\n\\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and\\n\\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles.\\n\\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role\\n\\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles,', 'deletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited\\n\\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall\\n\\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive\\n\\noperations.\\n\\nSeveral key authentication and authorization routes were developed:\\n\\n/login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If\\n\\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session\\n\\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests.\\n\\n/changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their\\n\\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in.\\n\\n/forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their\\n\\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset\\n\\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and', 'reliable email delivery.\\n\\n21\\n\\n/resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the\\n\\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to\\n\\nsecurely set a new password.\\n\\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a\\n\\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that\\n\\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control.\\n\\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with\\n\\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi-step event creation form were\\n\\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend\\n\\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and\\n\\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user-friendly', 'Event Management System for PSG College of Technology.\\n\\n22\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 GOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM\\n\\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection\\n\\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the\\n\\ncollege.

ComfyUI was examined for its capabilities in\\n\\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text-to-\\n\\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag-\\n\\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its\\n\\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate\\n\\nimage generation workflows.\", 'Familiarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored,\\n\\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and\\n\\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These\\n\\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video-to-video generation. Additionally,\\n\\nknowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like\\n\\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face,\\n\\nand GitHub were experimented with.\\n\\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs 33\\n\\n4.4\\n\\nCUSTOM NODES\\n\\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific\\n\\npurposes, was undertaken. These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through\\n\\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further\\n\\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation.', 'Contributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts\\n\\nand image-to-video workflows.

The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information. \\nThis EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event \\nplanning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload \\nphotos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details \\n \\n✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations. \\nSeveral key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege. This system plays a pivotal role in enhancing transparency, accountability, and \\ncommunication across the institution by enabling structured data collection and efficient report \\ngeneration for two half -yearly periods.

It simplifies infrastructure management, enabling developers and researchers to \\ntrain models and run experiments without complex setups. With a pay -as-you-go pricing \\nmodel, it's accessible to both individual developers and teams.\", '32  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.1 GPU Instances \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.2 Frameworks', '33  \\n4.3 COMFYUI AND AI IMAGE GENERATION \\n \\nThe journey began with an exploration of ComfyUI, a sophisticated stable diffusion \\ntool for AI-driven image and video generation. ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally, \\nknowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs', '34  \\n4.4 CUSTOM NODES \\n \\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific \\npurposes, was undertaken. These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through \\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further \\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation. \\nContributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts \\nand image-to-video workflows. Additionally, issues related to custom nodes and workflows \\nwere troubleshot and resolved. \\nFigure 4.4 Custom Nodes \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.5 ComfyUI Manager', '35  \\n4.5 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: COMFYUI DEPLOY \\n \\nAs part of a team, contributions were made to the development of ComfyUI Deploy, a \\nproduct aimed at reducing GPU consumption. Traditionally, GPUs were allocated and charged \\neven during workflow setup. The goal was to modify the existing code so that GPUs would be \\nutilized only when necessary —specifically, when the “Run” button was clicked. This was \\nachieved by integrating the ComfyUI interface into an iframe using Next.js and establishing \\nWebSocket connections. This significant improvement helped reduce GPU consumption for \\nusers while maintaining a smooth workflow experience. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 ComfyUI Deploy \\n \\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION \\n \\nThe skill set was expanded by working on data analysis and visualization tasks using \\nthe Streamlit tool. Initially, dummy data was used, but later, the focus shifted to analyzing real \\ncompany data, which included user transactions, GPU usage, and more. Detailed dashboards \\nwere created to visualize trends across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, \\nquarterly, yearly), providing the company with valuable insights.', '36  \\nBased on GPU Utilization \\n \\n• GPU Utilization: Visualizes the total GPU usage in hours across different time \\nperiods, helping track resource consumption. \\n• GPU Allocation: Shows the allocation of GPU resources across users or tasks, \\nproviding insights into how resources are distributed within the platform. \\n• Most Used GPU Type: Displays the most commonly used GPU type, helping \\nunderstand user preferences and optimize resource offerings. \\nBased on Users \\n \\n• Number of New Users: Tracks the total number of new users registered over a \\nspecified period, providing insights into user growth and platform adoption. \\n• Number of New Users Recharged: Monitors the count of new users who have made \\ntheir first recharge, indicating initial engagement and the effectiveness of onboarding \\nstrategies. \\n• Active Members Over Time: Visualizes the trend of active members over time, \\nhighlighting user retention and engagement levels on the platform. \\n• Churn Rate: Measures the percentage of users who stop using the service over a \\ngiven time frame, helping to assess user satisfaction and identify potential  areas for \\nimprovement. \\nBased on Recharge \\n \\n• Total Amount Recharged: Represents the cumulative amount of money recharged \\nby all users over a specified period, providing insights into overall platform revenue \\nand user investment. \\n• Total Amount Recharged by new Users: Tracks the total recharge amount \\ncontributed by new users, indicating their initial commitment and engagement with \\nthe platform shortly after registration.', '37  \\n• Total Amount Recharged by existing Users: Measures the total recharge amount \\nfrom existing users, reflecting ongoing user loyalty and continued usage of the \\nservice. \\n• Number of new users who Recharged within 1 month of creating their account: \\nCounts the number of new users who completed a recharge within the first month of \\naccount creation, highlighting the effectiveness of the onboarding process and user \\nconversion strategies. \\n4.7 DEVELOPMENT IN WEBSITE \\n \\nResponsibilities then shifted toward the frontend and backend development of the \\ncompany’s website, utilizing Next.js and FastAPI. New features such as invoice generation \\nand downloading, as well as the user interface for the file system, were developed. \\nIn the invoice generation feature, the jsPDF library was utilized to create PDF \\ndocuments efficiently. For Indian customers, the invoice defaults to applying GST, ensuring \\ncompliance with local tax regulations. For foreign customers, the applicable tax rate is \\nspecified, allowing for accurate billing based on their location. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Invoice Display', '38  \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.8 Invoice View \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.9 Invoice PDF', '39  \\nA file system storage is a service that enables users to store, manage, and access data \\nspecifically optimized for GPU workloads over the internet.

All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information.', 'This EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event', 'planning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload', 'photos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details', '✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations.', 'Several key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege. This system plays a pivotal role in enhancing transparency, accountability, and \\ncommunication across the institution by enabling structured data collection and efficient report \\ngeneration for two half -yearly periods. This chapter discusses the architecture, functionality, \\nand implementation of the system, which supports multiple roles and ensures efficient approval \\nworkflows. \\n3.1 INTRODUCTION \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is a centralized platform for managing \\ninstitutional reporting across various college departments and bodies. It facilitates the \\ncollection, review, and consolidation of semi -annual reports, streamlining approvals and', 'actions while promoting efficient decision-making and transparency across all college bodies. \\nThis system represents a significant step toward digital transformation in institutional \\nmanagement. The scalable architecture and comprehensive feature set ensure that the system \\ncan evolve with the institution’s growing needs while maintaining data integrity and security. \\n3.2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW \\n \\nThe system collects data from different bodies such as Academic, Faculties, \\nRepresentatives, Autonomous, Placement, NCC, NSS, PED, Personal Assistant, COE, and \\nothers. Each user, based on their role, can log in and contribute to their respective reports. Once \\nreports are completed, they are forwarded to the HOD for approval or further action. The \\nsystem ensures that all reports are submitted in a timely and structured format, which can then \\nbe consolidated and downloaded.', '24  \\n3.3 FEATURES \\nThe GC Data Collection System comprises of following features: \\n \\n• Role-based Access: Different user roles have specific access to sections of the \\nsystem. \\n• Data Entry and Progress Tracking: Users can view, edit, and track the progress \\nof their reports through an intuitive interface. \\n• Report Submission and Approval Workflow: Upon report completion, the HOD \\ncan approve or decline the report, with comments. If declined, the user can edit and \\nresubmit. \\n• Two Half-yearly Periods: The system handles reports for two half -year periods, \\nallowing users to edit and submit data for each. \\n• Report Generation and Download: The final consolidated report can be \\ndownloaded in a structured .docx format using a Pandoc Server. \\n \\nFigure 3.1 Governing Council Agenda', '25  \\n3.4 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System uses three tier architecture divided into \\nfrontend, backend and database components. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is built using React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive \\nuser experience. Each user is redirected to their respective dashboard upon login, \\nwhere they can mange their reports. The frontend provides interactive cards \\nrepresenting the two half-yearly periods, with options to edit or view reports. \\n• Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js using the Express framework. It \\nhandles routing, authentication, and data processing. The backend validates all \\ninputs using the Zod library and securely manages file uploads through Multer, \\nwhich are stored in MinIO for object storage. \\n• Database: The system uses PostgreSQL as its database, managed with Prisma ORM \\nfor efficient querying and data management. The database tracks user roles, report', 'progress, report content, and workflow status (whether a report is pending approval \\nor has been approved). \\n3.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\n \\nThe report and its related files are handled and stored in the following way, \\n \\n• Multer and MinIO: The system uses Multer for handling file uploads, which are \\nstored in MinIO as an object storage solution. This ensures that all media files \\nuploaded within the reports are securely stored and easily retrievable. \\n• Pandoc Server: The Pandoc Server is used for .docx  generation. Once reports are \\ncompleted and approved, they are downloaded using Pandoc. The Pandoc server \\nconverts HTML content from JoditEditor – WYSIWYG editor that allows users to \\nsee and edit content in a form that appears as it would when displayed on an interface,', '26  \\nwebpage, or printed document into .docx format, ensuring consistency in report \\nformatting. \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.2 JoditEditor \\n \\n3.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe database design for the system is structured to effectively manage and organize \\ndata related to departments, users, reports, and their associated elements. The database employs \\na relational model to maintain structured data integrity and facilitate efficient querying. Key \\nentities include: \\n• Department Table: Represents various departments within the organization, each \\nresponsible for specific functions and activities. \\n• User Table: Represents individuals working within departments who have access to \\nthe system. \\n• Report Table: Represents reports generated by departments, detailing their \\nactivities and progress. \\n• Object Table: Represents associated objects or attachments linked to reports. \\n \\n• ProgressStep Table: Represents individual steps in the progress tracking of a report.', '27  \\n• _ReportToUser Table: Join table that establishes a many-to-many relationships \\nbetween reports and users. \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.3 GC Data Collection System Schema \\n \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Department to Report – A department can have multiple reports. \\n \\n✓ Department to User – A department can have multiple users. \\n \\n✓ Report to Object – A report can have multiple associated objects. \\n \\n✓ Report to ProgressStep – A report can have multiple progress steps.', \"28  \\n• Many-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Report to User (_ReportToUser Table) – A report can be assigned to \\nmultiple users, and a user can be assigned to multiple reports through the \\n_ReportToUser join table. \\n \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another. \\n \\n3.7 USER WORKFLOW \\n \\nThe overall system workflow will be described here, \\n \\n• Login and Role -based Redirection: Upon login, users are redirected to their \\nrespective roles' pages.

The Pandoc server ensures that each report is \\nformatted uniformly and includes all media and data entered by users. \\nThis implementation exemplifies how the system leverages modern web technologies \\nto ensure a structured, transparent, and efficient reporting process from data entry to final report \\ngeneration.', '31  \\nCHAPTER 4 \\nPRODUCT OPTIMIZATION AND ENHANCEMENT \\n \\nThe project work at JarvisLabs.ai encompassed several phases, including the \\ndevelopment of AI workflows with ComfyUI and the optimization of GPU usage through the \\ncreation of the product ComfyUI Deploy. Features such as AnimateDiff and ControlNet were \\nexplored for creative content generation. Additionally, data analysis was conducted, \\ndashboards were created, and improvements were made to the company’s website by \\nimplementing API endpoints and enhancing the user experience with the addition of invoice \\ngeneration and a File System UI. \\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nDuring the internship period at JarvisLabs.ai, exposure was provided to various \\ninnovative tools and technologies aimed at optimizing GPU resource usage and facilitating \\ncreative AI workflows. The main objective of the company, providing GPU as a Service \\n(GaaS) on a cloud platform, was central to the project work, which introduced various aspects', \"of AI development, from image generation to cloud infrastructure optimization. \\n4.2 COMPANY PRODUCT \\n \\nJarvisLabs.ai is a cloud platform offering high -performance GPU instances (A5000, \\nA6000, RTX series) and pre -configured AI/ML environments with frameworks like PyTorch \\nand FastAI. It simplifies infrastructure management, enabling developers and researchers to \\ntrain models and run experiments without complex setups. With a pay -as-you-go pricing \\nmodel, it's accessible to both individual developers and teams.\", '32  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.1 GPU Instances \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.2 Frameworks', '33  \\n4.3 COMFYUI AND AI IMAGE GENERATION \\n \\nThe journey began with an exploration of ComfyUI, a sophisticated stable diffusion \\ntool for AI-driven image and video generation. ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally,', 'knowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs', '34  \\n4.4 CUSTOM NODES \\n \\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific \\npurposes, was undertaken. These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through \\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further \\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation. \\nContributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts \\nand image-to-video workflows. Additionally, issues related to custom nodes and workflows \\nwere troubleshot and resolved. \\nFigure 4.4 Custom Nodes \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.5 ComfyUI Manager', '35  \\n4.5 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: COMFYUI DEPLOY \\n \\nAs part of a team, contributions were made to the development of ComfyUI Deploy, a \\nproduct aimed at reducing GPU consumption. Traditionally, GPUs were allocated and charged \\neven during workflow setup. The goal was to modify the existing code so that GPUs would be \\nutilized only when necessary —specifically, when the “Run” button was clicked. This was \\nachieved by integrating the ComfyUI interface into an iframe using Next.js and establishing \\nWebSocket connections. This significant improvement helped reduce GPU consumption for \\nusers while maintaining a smooth workflow experience. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 ComfyUI Deploy \\n \\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION \\n \\nThe skill set was expanded by working on data analysis and visualization tasks using \\nthe Streamlit tool. Initially, dummy data was used, but later, the focus shifted to analyzing real \\ncompany data, which included user transactions, GPU usage, and more. Detailed dashboards', 'were created to visualize trends across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, \\nquarterly, yearly), providing the company with valuable insights.', '36  \\nBased on GPU Utilization \\n \\n• GPU Utilization: Visualizes the total GPU usage in hours across different time \\nperiods, helping track resource consumption. \\n• GPU Allocation: Shows the allocation of GPU resources across users or tasks, \\nproviding insights into how resources are distributed within the platform. \\n• Most Used GPU Type: Displays the most commonly used GPU type, helping \\nunderstand user preferences and optimize resource offerings. \\nBased on Users \\n \\n• Number of New Users: Tracks the total number of new users registered over a \\nspecified period, providing insights into user growth and platform adoption. \\n• Number of New Users Recharged: Monitors the count of new users who have made \\ntheir first recharge, indicating initial engagement and the effectiveness of onboarding \\nstrategies. \\n• Active Members Over Time: Visualizes the trend of active members over time, \\nhighlighting user retention and engagement levels on the platform.', '• Churn Rate: Measures the percentage of users who stop using the service over a \\ngiven time frame, helping to assess user satisfaction and identify potential  areas for \\nimprovement. \\nBased on Recharge \\n \\n• Total Amount Recharged: Represents the cumulative amount of money recharged \\nby all users over a specified period, providing insights into overall platform revenue \\nand user investment. \\n• Total Amount Recharged by new Users: Tracks the total recharge amount \\ncontributed by new users, indicating their initial commitment and engagement with \\nthe platform shortly after registration.', '37  \\n• Total Amount Recharged by existing Users: Measures the total recharge amount \\nfrom existing users, reflecting ongoing user loyalty and continued usage of the \\nservice. \\n• Number of new users who Recharged within 1 month of creating their account: \\nCounts the number of new users who completed a recharge within the first month of \\naccount creation, highlighting the effectiveness of the onboarding process and user \\nconversion strategies. \\n4.7 DEVELOPMENT IN WEBSITE \\n \\nResponsibilities then shifted toward the frontend and backend development of the \\ncompany’s website, utilizing Next.js and FastAPI. New features such as invoice generation \\nand downloading, as well as the user interface for the file system, were developed. \\nIn the invoice generation feature, the jsPDF library was utilized to create PDF \\ndocuments efficiently. For Indian customers, the invoice defaults to applying GST, ensuring \\ncompliance with local tax regulations. For foreign customers, the applicable tax rate is', 'specified, allowing for accurate billing based on their location. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Invoice Display', '38  \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.8 Invoice View \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.9 Invoice PDF', '39  \\nA file system storage is a service that enables users to store, manage, and access data \\nspecifically optimized for GPU workloads over the internet.

The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information.', 'This EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event', 'planning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload', 'photos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details', '✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations.', 'Several key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege.

The scalable architecture and comprehensive feature set ensure that the system \\ncan evolve with the institution’s growing needs while maintaining data integrity and security. \\n3.2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW \\n \\nThe system collects data from different bodies such as Academic, Faculties, \\nRepresentatives, Autonomous, Placement, NCC, NSS, PED, Personal Assistant, COE, and \\nothers. Each user, based on their role, can log in and contribute to their respective reports. Once \\nreports are completed, they are forwarded to the HOD for approval or further action. The \\nsystem ensures that all reports are submitted in a timely and structured format, which can then \\nbe consolidated and downloaded.', '24  \\n3.3 FEATURES \\nThe GC Data Collection System comprises of following features: \\n \\n• Role-based Access: Different user roles have specific access to sections of the \\nsystem. \\n• Data Entry and Progress Tracking: Users can view, edit, and track the progress \\nof their reports through an intuitive interface. \\n• Report Submission and Approval Workflow: Upon report completion, the HOD \\ncan approve or decline the report, with comments. If declined, the user can edit and \\nresubmit. \\n• Two Half-yearly Periods: The system handles reports for two half -year periods, \\nallowing users to edit and submit data for each. \\n• Report Generation and Download: The final consolidated report can be \\ndownloaded in a structured .docx format using a Pandoc Server. \\n \\nFigure 3.1 Governing Council Agenda', '25  \\n3.4 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System uses three tier architecture divided into \\nfrontend, backend and database components. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is built using React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive \\nuser experience. Each user is redirected to their respective dashboard upon login, \\nwhere they can mange their reports. The frontend provides interactive cards \\nrepresenting the two half-yearly periods, with options to edit or view reports. \\n• Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js using the Express framework. It \\nhandles routing, authentication, and data processing. The backend validates all \\ninputs using the Zod library and securely manages file uploads through Multer, \\nwhich are stored in MinIO for object storage. \\n• Database: The system uses PostgreSQL as its database, managed with Prisma ORM \\nfor efficient querying and data management. The database tracks user roles, report', 'progress, report content, and workflow status (whether a report is pending approval \\nor has been approved). \\n3.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\n \\nThe report and its related files are handled and stored in the following way, \\n \\n• Multer and MinIO: The system uses Multer for handling file uploads, which are \\nstored in MinIO as an object storage solution. This ensures that all media files \\nuploaded within the reports are securely stored and easily retrievable. \\n• Pandoc Server: The Pandoc Server is used for .docx  generation. Once reports are \\ncompleted and approved, they are downloaded using Pandoc. The Pandoc server \\nconverts HTML content from JoditEditor – WYSIWYG editor that allows users to \\nsee and edit content in a form that appears as it would when displayed on an interface,', '26  \\nwebpage, or printed document into .docx format, ensuring consistency in report \\nformatting. \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.2 JoditEditor \\n \\n3.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe database design for the system is structured to effectively manage and organize \\ndata related to departments, users, reports, and their associated elements. The database employs \\na relational model to maintain structured data integrity and facilitate efficient querying. Key \\nentities include: \\n• Department Table: Represents various departments within the organization, each \\nresponsible for specific functions and activities. \\n• User Table: Represents individuals working within departments who have access to \\nthe system. \\n• Report Table: Represents reports generated by departments, detailing their \\nactivities and progress. \\n• Object Table: Represents associated objects or attachments linked to reports. \\n \\n• ProgressStep Table: Represents individual steps in the progress tracking of a report.', '27  \\n• _ReportToUser Table: Join table that establishes a many-to-many relationships \\nbetween reports and users. \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.3 GC Data Collection System Schema \\n \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Department to Report – A department can have multiple reports. \\n \\n✓ Department to User – A department can have multiple users. \\n \\n✓ Report to Object – A report can have multiple associated objects. \\n \\n✓ Report to ProgressStep – A report can have multiple progress steps.', \"28  \\n• Many-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Report to User (_ReportToUser Table) – A report can be assigned to \\nmultiple users, and a user can be assigned to multiple reports through the \\n_ReportToUser join table. \\n \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another. \\n \\n3.7 USER WORKFLOW \\n \\nThe overall system workflow will be described here, \\n \\n• Login and Role -based Redirection: Upon login, users are redirected to their \\nrespective roles' pages. Each role sees fields relevant to them and can contribute to \\nthe report for each half-year. \\nFigure 3.4 Authentication Page \\n \\n• Progress Tracking and Report Entry: Users can see the progress of their reports. \\n \\nIf the half-year period is active, users can edit or delete their reports. The JoditEditor \\ninterface allows them to add content and updates.\", '29  \\n \\nFigure 3.5 Biannual Cards \\n \\n• Submission and Approval: After all required fields are filled, users submit their \\nreports. The status changes to \"Action from HOD,\" and the editing option is disabled. \\nThe HOD can then review, comment, and approve or decline the report. Declined \\nreports can be edited and resubmitted. \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.6 Action Page', '30  \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.7 Confirmation Page \\n \\n• Report Consolidation and Download: At the end of the half -year period, the \\nsystem consolidates all submitted reports and allows for the download of a zip file \\ncontaining the reports in .docx format. The Pandoc server ensures that each report is \\nformatted uniformly and includes all media and data entered by users. \\nThis implementation exemplifies how the system leverages modern web technologies \\nto ensure a structured, transparent, and efficient reporting process from data entry to final report \\ngeneration.', '31  \\nCHAPTER 4 \\nPRODUCT OPTIMIZATION AND ENHANCEMENT \\n \\nThe project work at JarvisLabs.ai encompassed several phases, including the \\ndevelopment of AI workflows with ComfyUI and the optimization of GPU usage through the \\ncreation of the product ComfyUI Deploy. Features such as AnimateDiff and ControlNet were \\nexplored for creative content generation. Additionally, data analysis was conducted, \\ndashboards were created, and improvements were made to the company’s website by \\nimplementing API endpoints and enhancing the user experience with the addition of invoice \\ngeneration and a File System UI. \\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nDuring the internship period at JarvisLabs.ai, exposure was provided to various \\ninnovative tools and technologies aimed at optimizing GPU resource usage and facilitating \\ncreative AI workflows. The main objective of the company, providing GPU as a Service \\n(GaaS) on a cloud platform, was central to the project work, which introduced various aspects', \"of AI development, from image generation to cloud infrastructure optimization. \\n4.2 COMPANY PRODUCT \\n \\nJarvisLabs.ai is a cloud platform offering high -performance GPU instances (A5000, \\nA6000, RTX series) and pre -configured AI/ML environments with frameworks like PyTorch \\nand FastAI. It simplifies infrastructure management, enabling developers and researchers to \\ntrain models and run experiments without complex setups. With a pay -as-you-go pricing \\nmodel, it's accessible to both individual developers and teams.\", '32  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.1 GPU Instances \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.2 Frameworks', '33  \\n4.3 COMFYUI AND AI IMAGE GENERATION \\n \\nThe journey began with an exploration of ComfyUI, a sophisticated stable diffusion \\ntool for AI-driven image and video generation. ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally,', 'knowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs', '34  \\n4.4 CUSTOM NODES \\n \\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific \\npurposes, was undertaken. These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through \\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further \\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation. \\nContributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts \\nand image-to-video workflows. Additionally, issues related to custom nodes and workflows \\nwere troubleshot and resolved. \\nFigure 4.4 Custom Nodes \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.5 ComfyUI Manager', '35  \\n4.5 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: COMFYUI DEPLOY \\n \\nAs part of a team, contributions were made to the development of ComfyUI Deploy, a \\nproduct aimed at reducing GPU consumption. Traditionally, GPUs were allocated and charged \\neven during workflow setup. The goal was to modify the existing code so that GPUs would be \\nutilized only when necessary —specifically, when the “Run” button was clicked. This was \\nachieved by integrating the ComfyUI interface into an iframe using Next.js and establishing \\nWebSocket connections. This significant improvement helped reduce GPU consumption for \\nusers while maintaining a smooth workflow experience. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 ComfyUI Deploy \\n \\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION \\n \\nThe skill set was expanded by working on data analysis and visualization tasks using \\nthe Streamlit tool. Initially, dummy data was used, but later, the focus shifted to analyzing real \\ncompany data, which included user transactions, GPU usage, and more. Detailed dashboards', 'were created to visualize trends across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, \\nquarterly, yearly), providing the company with valuable insights.', '36  \\nBased on GPU Utilization \\n \\n• GPU Utilization: Visualizes the total GPU usage in hours across different time \\nperiods, helping track resource consumption. \\n• GPU Allocation: Shows the allocation of GPU resources across users or tasks, \\nproviding insights into how resources are distributed within the platform. \\n• Most Used GPU Type: Displays the most commonly used GPU type, helping \\nunderstand user preferences and optimize resource offerings. \\nBased on Users \\n \\n• Number of New Users: Tracks the total number of new users registered over a \\nspecified period, providing insights into user growth and platform adoption. \\n• Number of New Users Recharged: Monitors the count of new users who have made \\ntheir first recharge, indicating initial engagement and the effectiveness of onboarding \\nstrategies. \\n• Active Members Over Time: Visualizes the trend of active members over time, \\nhighlighting user retention and engagement levels on the platform.', '• Churn Rate: Measures the percentage of users who stop using the service over a \\ngiven time frame, helping to assess user satisfaction and identify potential  areas for \\nimprovement. \\nBased on Recharge \\n \\n• Total Amount Recharged: Represents the cumulative amount of money recharged \\nby all users over a specified period, providing insights into overall platform revenue \\nand user investment. \\n• Total Amount Recharged by new Users: Tracks the total recharge amount \\ncontributed by new users, indicating their initial commitment and engagement with \\nthe platform shortly after registration.', '37  \\n• Total Amount Recharged by existing Users: Measures the total recharge amount \\nfrom existing users, reflecting ongoing user loyalty and continued usage of the \\nservice. \\n• Number of new users who Recharged within 1 month of creating their account: \\nCounts the number of new users who completed a recharge within the first month of \\naccount creation, highlighting the effectiveness of the onboarding process and user \\nconversion strategies. \\n4.7 DEVELOPMENT IN WEBSITE \\n \\nResponsibilities then shifted toward the frontend and backend development of the \\ncompany’s website, utilizing Next.js and FastAPI. New features such as invoice generation \\nand downloading, as well as the user interface for the file system, were developed. \\nIn the invoice generation feature, the jsPDF library was utilized to create PDF \\ndocuments efficiently. For Indian customers, the invoice defaults to applying GST, ensuring \\ncompliance with local tax regulations. For foreign customers, the applicable tax rate is', 'specified, allowing for accurate billing based on their location. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Invoice Display', '38  \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.8 Invoice View \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.9 Invoice PDF', '39  \\nA file system storage is a service that enables users to store, manage, and access data \\nspecifically optimized for GPU workloads over the internet.

The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information.', 'This EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event', 'planning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload', 'photos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details', '✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations.', 'Several key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege.

The system \\naddresses the challenging of organizing, recording, and displaying various college events, \\nranging from major conferences to minor departmental activities. Traditionally, event \\nmanagement can be fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in communication, planning, and \\ntracking. This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information.', 'This EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event', 'planning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload', 'photos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details', '✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations.', 'Several key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege.

ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally,', 'knowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs', '34  \\n4.4 CUSTOM NODES \\n \\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific \\npurposes, was undertaken.

This EMS centralizes the process, enabling administrators and organizers to create, \\nupdate, and mange events efficiently. \\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) offers functionalities to record event details \\nbefore they occur and allows the upload of event -related images after the events have \\nconcluded. All events are displayed on the frontend page, categorized as upcoming or past, \\nwith filter capabilities to allow users to quickly access relevant event information.', 'This EMS is tailored specifically for PSG College of Technology to improve \\ncoordination and streamline event -related processes, fostering better collaboration across \\nvarious departments and ensuring that all event information is easily accessible and up to date. \\n2.2 SYSTEM FLOW \\n \\nThe EMS follows a structured workflow that ensures smooth event management from \\ncreation to post -event updates. Each step is designed to centralize event data and improve \\naccessibility for both organizers and users. \\n• Event Creation: Organizers input details such as event name, date, time, venue, \\ndescription and other details through the system. \\n• Database Management: All event information stored in a centralized database \\nbefore the event, with post-event uploads for images or files.', '16  \\n• Event Display: Events are showcased on the website’s frontend, categorized into \\nupcoming and past events. \\n• Post-Event Updates: After an event, organizers can upload event images and other \\nrelevant materials. \\n• Filtering and Viewing: Users can filter events by criteria such as date and category \\nto quickly find specific event information. \\n2.3 OBJECTIVES \\n \\nThe main goal of the Event Management System (EMS) are as follows, \\n \\n• Automating event management tasks to reduce manual effort and improve \\nefficiency. \\n• Providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy creation and management of \\nevent details. \\n• Enabling file uploads using Multer and secure storage with MinIO for event-related \\nmedia. \\n• Facilitating admin control over event data to ensure proper coordination and \\naccuracy. \\n• Improving accessibility by displaying event information in an organized and easily \\nfilterable format. \\n• Enhancing collaboration between organizers and administrators for seamless event', 'planning. \\n2.4 SYSTEM DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) follows a three-tier architecture, with clear \\nseparation between the frontend, backend, and database. \\n• UI/UX Design: The UI was designed using Figma, focusing on user roles such as \\nadmin and organizer. The goal was to provide a clear interface for managing event', '17  \\ndetails, with an intuitive event dashboard, event list filtering, and file uploads and \\nstorage. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is started building using React, which communicates with \\nthe backend through REST APIs, displaying event data and allowing interaction via \\na user-friendly interface. \\n• Backend: Developed with Nest.js, it handles business logic, routes requests, \\nauthentication logic, and manages event data using PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM. \\nThe backend processes event CRUD operations, file storage, and user authentication. \\n• File Storage: MinIO is used as the object storage system for event -related files, \\nwhich are uploaded using Multer and linked via database records. \\n2.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\nThe files related to EMS are handled in the following way: \\n \\n• MinIO: MinIO (Object Storage) is used to store multimedia content, such as images \\nor documents uploaded post-event. After an event concludes, organizers can upload', 'photos, flyers, or reports, which are stored securely in MinIO’s object storage \\nsystem. It provides a high -performance, scalable object storage solution that \\nintegrates well with the EMS, allowing for secure and efficient storage and retrieval \\nof large media files. It uploads and pre-signed URL is generated for the file uploaded \\nwhich will be later used to fetch the file from cloud storage. \\n• Multer: Multer is used in the backend to handle file uploads. Organizers can upload \\nevent-related images and documents, which are then processed and stored in MinIO. \\nIt simplifies file handling by efficiently processing multipart form data (used for file \\nuploads), ensuring that uploaded files are correctly handled and passed to the object \\nstorage.', '18  \\n2.6 DATABASE DESIGN \\n \\nThe Event Management System (EMS) database is designed to manage users, events, \\nand file storage. Key tables include: \\n• Users Table: Manages user roles (admin, organizer) and authentication. \\n \\n• Profile Table: Stores profile information for each user. \\n \\n• Events Table: Stores core event information. \\n \\n• Event Details Table: Holds extended event-specific details. \\n \\n• Media Files Table: Stores media related to the event. \\n \\n• Event Host Table: Stores hosts of the event. \\n \\n• Registration Table: Handles event registrations. \\n \\n• Competitions Table: Manages information about competitions related to events. \\n \\n• Prizes Table: Stores prize information for competitions. \\n \\n• Guest Speakers Table: Stores guest or speaker details. \\n \\n• Sponsors Table: Stores sponsorship details. \\n \\n• Event Files Table: Handles additional media files like documents, images, or \\nvideos. \\nDatabase relationships: \\n \\n• One-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Details', '✓ Events and Registration \\n \\n• One-to-Many: \\n \\n✓ Users and Profile \\n \\n✓ Users and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Host \\n \\n✓ Events and Media Files', '19  \\n✓ Events and Competitions \\n \\n✓ Events and Guests/Speakers \\n \\n✓ Events and Sponsors \\n \\n✓ Events and Event Files \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Prizes \\n \\n• Many-to-One: \\n \\n✓ Event Details and Events (each detail belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Media Files and Events (each media file belong to one event) \\n \\n✓ Registration and Events (each registration belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Competitions and Events (each competition belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Guests/Speakers and Events (each guest/speaker belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Sponsors and Events (each sponsor belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Event Files and Events (each file belongs to one event) \\n \\n✓ Prizes and Competitions (each prize belongs to one competition) \\nThis structure clarifies how entities in the database interact with one another.', 'Figure 2.1 EMS \\n20', '21  \\n2.7 IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nIn the implementation of the Event Management System (EMS), the primary \\ncontribution involved developing the authentication and authorization mechanisms using \\nNestJS and TypeScript. A role-based access control (RBAC) system was implemented, a \\nsecurity approach in which permissions are assigned based on user roles rather than individual \\nuser accounts. This mechanism ensures that users are granted access only to resources and \\nactions appropriate for their assigned roles. \\nIn the EMS, two primary roles were defined: admin and organizer. The admin role \\nwas designed to allow the creation of users with the organizer role, setting of user roles, \\ndeletion of users if necessary, and listing of all users. The organizer role was given limited \\naccess, allowing only the addition of event data. This structured approach enhances overall \\nsecurity by ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the system’s sensitive \\noperations.', 'Several key authentication and authorization routes were developed: \\n \\n• /login: This endpoint handles user login by verifying the user’s credentials. If \\nsuccessful, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued, which is used to manage session \\nstorage and authentication for subsequent requests. \\n• /changePassword: This endpoint allows authenticated users to change their \\npassword. It ensures that users can securely update their credentials while logged in. \\n• /forgotPassword: This route handles password recovery. When a user submits their \\nemail, the system generates a JWT reset token and sends it via email with a reset \\nlink. I used Nodemailer to handle the sending of these emails, ensuring smooth and \\nreliable email delivery.', '22  \\n• /resetPassword: This endpoint is accessed via the reset link sent in the \\nforgotPassword email. It verifies the JWT token from the link, allowing the user to \\nsecurely set a new password. \\nFor session management, JWT was used to store session information, providing a \\nsecure and scalable solution for user authentication across the EMS. This approach ensures that \\nsession data is easily validated, supporting efficient and secure user access control. \\nAfter the backend was completed, focus shifted to the frontend, designed in React with \\nuser interfaces crafted in Figma. User interfaces and a multi -step event creation form were \\ndeveloped in Figma to streamline the event management process for organizers. The frontend \\ninteracts with backend APIs to display upcoming and past events, allowing users to filter and \\naccess detailed event information. This cohesive approach delivers a robust and user -friendly \\nEvent Management System for PSG College of Technology.', '23  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\nGOVERNING COUNCIL DATA COLLECTION \\nSYSTEM \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is designed to streamline the collection \\nand management of institutional reports from various departments and bodies within the \\ncollege. This system plays a pivotal role in enhancing transparency, accountability, and \\ncommunication across the institution by enabling structured data collection and efficient report \\ngeneration for two half -yearly periods. This chapter discusses the architecture, functionality, \\nand implementation of the system, which supports multiple roles and ensures efficient approval \\nworkflows. \\n3.1 INTRODUCTION \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System is a centralized platform for managing \\ninstitutional reporting across various college departments and bodies. It facilitates the \\ncollection, review, and consolidation of semi -annual reports, streamlining approvals and', 'actions while promoting efficient decision-making and transparency across all college bodies. \\nThis system represents a significant step toward digital transformation in institutional \\nmanagement. The scalable architecture and comprehensive feature set ensure that the system \\ncan evolve with the institution’s growing needs while maintaining data integrity and security. \\n3.2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW \\n \\nThe system collects data from different bodies such as Academic, Faculties, \\nRepresentatives, Autonomous, Placement, NCC, NSS, PED, Personal Assistant, COE, and \\nothers. Each user, based on their role, can log in and contribute to their respective reports. Once \\nreports are completed, they are forwarded to the HOD for approval or further action. The \\nsystem ensures that all reports are submitted in a timely and structured format, which can then \\nbe consolidated and downloaded.', '24  \\n3.3 FEATURES \\nThe GC Data Collection System comprises of following features: \\n \\n• Role-based Access: Different user roles have specific access to sections of the \\nsystem. \\n• Data Entry and Progress Tracking: Users can view, edit, and track the progress \\nof their reports through an intuitive interface. \\n• Report Submission and Approval Workflow: Upon report completion, the HOD \\ncan approve or decline the report, with comments. If declined, the user can edit and \\nresubmit. \\n• Two Half-yearly Periods: The system handles reports for two half -year periods, \\nallowing users to edit and submit data for each. \\n• Report Generation and Download: The final consolidated report can be \\ndownloaded in a structured .docx format using a Pandoc Server. \\n \\nFigure 3.1 Governing Council Agenda', '25  \\n3.4 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \\nThe Governing Council Data Collection System uses three tier architecture divided into \\nfrontend, backend and database components. \\n• Frontend: The frontend is built using React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive \\nuser experience. Each user is redirected to their respective dashboard upon login, \\nwhere they can mange their reports. The frontend provides interactive cards \\nrepresenting the two half-yearly periods, with options to edit or view reports. \\n• Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js using the Express framework. It \\nhandles routing, authentication, and data processing. The backend validates all \\ninputs using the Zod library and securely manages file uploads through Multer, \\nwhich are stored in MinIO for object storage. \\n• Database: The system uses PostgreSQL as its database, managed with Prisma ORM \\nfor efficient querying and data management. The database tracks user roles, report', 'progress, report content, and workflow status (whether a report is pending approval \\nor has been approved). \\n3.5 FILE HANDLING AND STORAGE \\n \\nThe report and its related files are handled and stored in the following way, \\n \\n• Multer and MinIO: The system uses Multer for handling file uploads, which are \\nstored in MinIO as an object storage solution. This ensures that all media files \\nuploaded within the reports are securely stored and easily retrievable. \\n• Pandoc Server: The Pandoc Server is used for .docx  generation. Once reports are \\ncompleted and approved, they are downloaded using Pandoc.

Features such as AnimateDiff and ControlNet were \\nexplored for creative content generation. Additionally, data analysis was conducted, \\ndashboards were created, and improvements were made to the company’s website by \\nimplementing API endpoints and enhancing the user experience with the addition of invoice \\ngeneration and a File System UI. \\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \\n \\nDuring the internship period at JarvisLabs.ai, exposure was provided to various \\ninnovative tools and technologies aimed at optimizing GPU resource usage and facilitating \\ncreative AI workflows. The main objective of the company, providing GPU as a Service \\n(GaaS) on a cloud platform, was central to the project work, which introduced various aspects', \"of AI development, from image generation to cloud infrastructure optimization. \\n4.2 COMPANY PRODUCT \\n \\nJarvisLabs.ai is a cloud platform offering high -performance GPU instances (A5000, \\nA6000, RTX series) and pre -configured AI/ML environments with frameworks like PyTorch \\nand FastAI. It simplifies infrastructure management, enabling developers and researchers to \\ntrain models and run experiments without complex setups. With a pay -as-you-go pricing \\nmodel, it's accessible to both individual developers and teams.\", '32  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.1 GPU Instances \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.2 Frameworks', '33  \\n4.3 COMFYUI AND AI IMAGE GENERATION \\n \\nThe journey began with an exploration of ComfyUI, a sophisticated stable diffusion \\ntool for AI-driven image and video generation. ComfyUI  was examined for its capabilities in \\nsimplifying the use of stable diffusion models, such as SDXL, SD1.5, and SD2.x, for text -to- \\nimage or video generation. Through this interface, users are enabled to connect nodes in a drag- \\nand-drop manner, facilitating the creation of complex image generation pipelines. Its \\ndistinctive feature—a node-based graphical interface—allows for the construction of intricate \\nimage generation workflows. \\nFamiliarization with the platform was achieved, and several features were explored, \\nincluding AnimateDiff, used to create smooth animations from image sequences, and \\nControlNet, which enables precise control over image generation using reference points. These \\nexplorations resulted in creative outputs, such as video -to-video generation. Additionally,', 'knowledge was gained about Lora models, which are trained on top of existing models like \\nSD1.5 or SDXL, and various Lora models available on platforms like Civitai, Hugging Face, \\nand GitHub were experimented with. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.3 Workflow Outputs', '34  \\n4.4 CUSTOM NODES \\n \\nInstallation of custom nodes, which are not available by default but serve specific \\npurposes, was undertaken. These nodes were installed using ComfyUI Manager or through \\nterminal commands from platforms like GitHub, Hugging Face, and Civitai. Skills were further \\nhoned by participating in a company hackathon focused on creative content generation. \\nContributions included the development of workflows such as video creation based on prompts \\nand image-to-video workflows. Additionally, issues related to custom nodes and workflows \\nwere troubleshot and resolved. \\nFigure 4.4 Custom Nodes \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.5 ComfyUI Manager', '35  \\n4.5 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: COMFYUI DEPLOY \\n \\nAs part of a team, contributions were made to the development of ComfyUI Deploy, a \\nproduct aimed at reducing GPU consumption. Traditionally, GPUs were allocated and charged \\neven during workflow setup. The goal was to modify the existing code so that GPUs would be \\nutilized only when necessary —specifically, when the “Run” button was clicked. This was \\nachieved by integrating the ComfyUI interface into an iframe using Next.js and establishing \\nWebSocket connections. This significant improvement helped reduce GPU consumption for \\nusers while maintaining a smooth workflow experience. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 ComfyUI Deploy \\n \\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION \\n \\nThe skill set was expanded by working on data analysis and visualization tasks using \\nthe Streamlit tool. Initially, dummy data was used, but later, the focus shifted to analyzing real \\ncompany data, which included user transactions, GPU usage, and more. Detailed dashboards', 'were created to visualize trends across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, \\nquarterly, yearly), providing the company with valuable insights.', '36  \\nBased on GPU Utilization \\n \\n• GPU Utilization: Visualizes the total GPU usage in hours across different time \\nperiods, helping track resource consumption. \\n• GPU Allocation: Shows the allocation of GPU resources across users or tasks, \\nproviding insights into how resources are distributed within the platform. \\n• Most Used GPU Type: Displays the most commonly used GPU type, helping \\nunderstand user preferences and optimize resource offerings. \\nBased on Users \\n \\n• Number of New Users: Tracks the total number of new users registered over a \\nspecified period, providing insights into user growth and platform adoption. \\n• Number of New Users Recharged: Monitors the count of new users who have made \\ntheir first recharge, indicating initial engagement and the effectiveness of onboarding \\nstrategies. \\n• Active Members Over Time: Visualizes the trend of active members over time, \\nhighlighting user retention and engagement levels on the platform.', '• Churn Rate: Measures the percentage of users who stop using the service over a \\ngiven time frame, helping to assess user satisfaction and identify potential  areas for \\nimprovement. \\nBased on Recharge \\n \\n• Total Amount Recharged: Represents the cumulative amount of money recharged \\nby all users over a specified period, providing insights into overall platform revenue \\nand user investment. \\n• Total Amount Recharged by new Users: Tracks the total recharge amount \\ncontributed by new users, indicating their initial commitment and engagement with \\nthe platform shortly after registration.', '37  \\n• Total Amount Recharged by existing Users: Measures the total recharge amount \\nfrom existing users, reflecting ongoing user loyalty and continued usage of the \\nservice. \\n• Number of new users who Recharged within 1 month of creating their account: \\nCounts the number of new users who completed a recharge within the first month of \\naccount creation, highlighting the effectiveness of the onboarding process and user \\nconversion strategies. \\n4.7 DEVELOPMENT IN WEBSITE \\n \\nResponsibilities then shifted toward the frontend and backend development of the \\ncompany’s website, utilizing Next.js and FastAPI. New features such as invoice generation \\nand downloading, as well as the user interface for the file system, were developed. \\nIn the invoice generation feature, the jsPDF library was utilized to create PDF \\ndocuments efficiently. For Indian customers, the invoice defaults to applying GST, ensuring \\ncompliance with local tax regulations. For foreign customers, the applicable tax rate is', 'specified, allowing for accurate billing based on their location. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Invoice Display', '38  \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.8 Invoice View \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.9 Invoice PDF', '39  \\nA file system storage is a service that enables users to store, manage, and access data \\nspecifically optimized for GPU workloads over the internet.
